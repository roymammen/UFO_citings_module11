# UFO_citings_module11

1.	Overview: 

    The purpose of this analysis is to create a filter to Danaâ€™s webpage using dynamic table to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings, by supporting user selectable filtration to the UFO sightings.

2.	Results: 

    Four, additional filter items were added which supplies user input to java scrip function to create a desirable dynamic web page. 

    The dynamic filter table which filers on multiple items from user input was successfully implemented and tested.

3.	Summary: 

    Drawback of this web-page:
	      The main draw back to this refactoring is that the function is not optimized. But for the limited UFO sightings, this code will be sufficient.
    
    Recommendation for further development:
      a. It is advisable to find a more performance based filter scheme in Java script which will be more time saving with reduced for loop
      b. It should be possible to upload and update new UFO sightings to the base data, by which the website is more
